The dark woods~
You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
A small sign is posted here.

The dark woods~
You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal trees
line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light spear
down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.
The path winds north and south into darkness.

intersection. It is almost as though you are in a circle of light that
provides sanctuary in this land of darkness.
Something has been scrawled in the dirt in blood here.

its deadly darkness and silence. Looking west, you see a path that leads up

This is a small intersection. Paths lead east, west, and south. You are struck
by the carnage here when you enter the clearing. There appears to have been a
great battle here. Blood is everywhere and the ground is all torn up. Pieces
of beaten armour and broken blades lie all around. Examining the tracks here
lead you to believe that the dead and wounded were dragged off in two 
directions, south and east.

deeper into the foothills or to the west where a small pass will allow you to

Before the huge tree~
You enter a large ring of boulders. Sheltered by this wall of stones, a small
cluster of plants have sprung up. In the center of this group of trees and
bushes is a huge gnarled tree. It appears to have been twisted and torn by
the forces of nature. It sways and moans as a strong wind from the south tears
through its old feeble branches. The hills themselves lead in all directions.

north, south, and west.

Inside the horrid cave~
The stench is overwhelming. You can hardly breathe as you enter the cave.
Looking around, you realize that some bizarre and horrible creature uses this
cave as a home. Skeletal remains lie all over. Several half-eaten corpses are
rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a
large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and plant matter. Light and safety is
towards the west.

shoreline. It appears as though a vast ocean is to the south. Sea birds have
made their nests here in the rocks and you are heartened by the presence of
life here. It is possible to climb down to the shore here. The hills
themselves are to the north. The edge of the hills leads to the east along the

You stand on a barren section of hills that overlook a rocky shoreline. The
stiff ocean wind has blown the rocks smooth here and you have to lean forward
a bit to keep your balance. The salty sea air fills your nostrils and you
notice signs of life in the rocky crags here. You can climb down towards the
shore or head north into the hills themselves. The rocky summit you are
standing leads east and west along the shoreline.

The rocky shoreline~
You are on a rocky shore that borders a vast sea. A stiff wind blows here and
whistles among the rocks. You see an altar of some sort built on the shore to
the south. The shore itself leads east and west. Looking up, you see foothills
and rocky crags.

The rocky shore~
You stand at the base of some rocky hills, where they meet a rocky shore. A
vast sea is to your south. Looking to the southwest, you see a small altar
that glows with a eerie blue light. The shore stretches out to the south and
west. It is possible to climb up into the hills here.

The Blood Sea Portal~
You stand on a small pedestal like altar that has been built on the shore here.
Standing here, you can look out across the sea. You can almost imagine that
you see a far away island. Dominating the altar is a small blue portal of
light. It is possible to walk south into the portal. The shore itself extends
to the north, east, and west.
There are small inscriptions on the rock at the base of the portal.

The edge of the sea~
You walk along the water's edge. The tide appears to have risen. Very little
debris is washed up on shore. You slip and slide as you tread across the
slippery rocks that make up the shore. To the west you see a small altar that

"windows" in the sea of blue here. One to the south shows an image of a snowy
plain. Another window the the north shows an image of a rocky shore.

out all light and stifle the wind. You smell swamp gas and hear damp squashing
sounds all around you. The path leads east deeper into the swamp. You also see
