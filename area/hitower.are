Entrance to the Shadow Grove~
Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
  A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.

A small clearing~
You are in a small clearing in the shadow grove. There is charred grass
underfoot, and the signs of fire here and there. It is almost as if the
plant life shuns this spot. The shadowy mist hovers all around, obscuring
your view into the grove.

The reading room~
You are in a small room completely devoid of furnishings. The only thing
here is an enormous tome, lying face open on the floor. The great book looks
both heavy and ancient. Its jewel encrusted bindings are well worn as the
bark of a tree. Spidery writings seem to crawls across the pages, totally
incomprehensible to your mortal eye. Something seems to be wedged between
the pages.

a multi-colored hallway swirling with patterns that remain just barely
unrecognizable is to the north.
