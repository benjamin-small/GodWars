Entrance to the Mob Factory~
You find that you have entered a strange factory. This factory doesn't
make cars or computers or something - it makes mobs! The sound of
machinery can be heard in the background; the grinding gears drive you
crazy! To the north you see the storage area, to the south the
foreman's office, to the east the entrance hallway, and to the west the
eastern end of alley.

Foreman's Bathroom~
This is the place where the foreman makes frequent visits. The smell
here is very strong and reminds you of bovine excrement! There is a
shower to the back, and a urinal to the left. On the floor you can
see stains of a very suspicious nature. The only exit leads north to
the foreman's office.
