Inside a small tent~
This is a small and simple tent with few possessions in sight. Lying
here and there are young-looking men and women, possibly slaves to the
leader of this band.

Beside the camels~
Here stand about ten camels, all hitched to some stakes plugged into
the ground. To the east you see a small tent while to the north you see a
larger, fancier tent.

The main tent~
This tent is as lavishly decorated on the inside as it is on the

walls.

This is where the leader of this band of nomads resides. He is

paintings as well.

Strange Glowing Sand~
A vast desert stretches for miles, the sand constantly shifting around you.
But this patch of desert looks different ... the sand glows.  You see a
futuristic city to the south.

The wind-swept ledge~
Being very careful not to lose your balance, you look around and
find that this canyon is about a half a kilometer deep. To the west is
a dark cave leading under the desert sands.

The mysterious lair.~
You have stumbled upon the home of something. From the treasure
haphazardly strewn about and the rotting carcasses, you would guess that
this is a dragon's lair. As to what type, you can't really say. The cave
narrows out into a tunnel to the west.
