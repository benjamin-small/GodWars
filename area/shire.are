elven wizard~
the Elven Wizard~
An Elven Wizard is here, creating fireworks for the festivities.
~
The Elven Wizard looks at you in a solemn sort of way.  His gaze seems to
penetrate through your innermost being.  He is wearing a silvery cloak
and holding a multi-colored staff.  Although he appears to be older
than the oldest man, he seems to have an inner strength which most mortals
cannot overcome.

ring keeper~
the Keeper of the Ring~
The Keeper of the Ring is here, guarding his treasure jealously.
~
The Ring Keeper is a rather big but short halfling.  His short stature and
bulbous nose belie his true nature.  An elven sword that glows with a blue
light hangs from his belt, and on his finger you see the One Ring.  Although
usually a halfling of peace, he will fight you to the death if you attempt
to take away that which belongs to him.
