Indeed it is too bright to tell.  Because what you are witnessing is the
rare event of a Supernova, how a star explodes itself into galactic dust.
You may find yourself lucky to witness this rare event but even luckier,
you have finally got out of this galaxy as your body turns into dust.
That really HURTS!
