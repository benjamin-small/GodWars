By the River~
The water in the river seems to bubble and froth with magic.  Though it
splashes playfully on you, it does not seem wet.  The path leads north closer
to the water. To the west you see a T-intersection.

To continue you had to walk right in the river.  Though you walk along in
water up to your knees, you do not seem to get wet.  A bay stretches out to
the north and the river goes south.

from beneath your feet much to quick for you to recover.  Instead of
plunging to your death, you seemingly miss the ground and begin walking
on air.  The space to the north and east seems just thin air, but you can
walk there.  The pathway you came from is to the south.

This is a stunning vista overlooking a canyon.  There is a sign here that says:

	BEHOLD -- ELEMENTAL CANYON

Fire leaps up from firepits in the western part of the canyon.  The sky looks
funny, and the air seems hazy to the northwest.  Electricity sparks
intermittently in the northeast.  To the east you see a strong, magic-looking
river flowing through the canyon.  Also to the east you spy a cave entrance
leading into the canyon wall.  The path descends to the north to another
