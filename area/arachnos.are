The Single Spider Line~
A single spider line supports you once more.  As you look
across the ether you seen a single shack up ahead with a light in
the window.  You sense a great evil coming from the east and feel
inclined to go back on the ethereal web and take your chances there.

The Hermit's Corner~
Here you see evidence of a vagrant's abode.  The shack is to the
east, if you dare enter it.  You get the sneaking feeling you should
go back now.  The skies above you darken and roar with the laughter
of thunder.

The Sticky Chamber~
You can still bail out since your knees are shaking from the
anticipation (or is it fear?).  The sky is clear on this strand of
web, surprisingly unsticky.  The strand does not vibrate like the
others.  A few ballooning spiders pass by, cackling "You're gonna
die, you're gonna fry.  Good bye!"

The Great Door~
Before you you see a large, web-like door.  Various designs
of ancient runes and names of Midgaard heroes are etched into
the webwork.  Perhaps lists of victims?  You can't tell.

This is the lair of the Empress Spider, Arachnos.  A lavishly
adorned rainbow web, her lair allows her to move to any universe
she wishes by using her magical strands to the Prime Material Plane.

tunately Arachnos is a baggy spider too, and webs all her treasures
to her beautiful silken body.
