Climbing the Great Pyramid~
Here the elements have carved away at the sides of the pyramid quite a 
bit.  You aren't so sure of your footing anymore...

Suddenly the wind picks up, and you lose your balance!
You tumble down the side of the pyramid, and fall to your death!

SPLAT.

You are caught in the midst of a massive sandstorm.  Howling winds

A Massive Sand Dune~
Somehow you managed to make your way through the howling winds
of the sandstorm, and clamber up on this sand dune.  You can see the
storm to the north of you, and presumably the pyramid is somewhere
beyond it.  Nothing but flat, featureless, open dunes of sand lie in
every other direction.
