A Dark Alleyway~
The walls of the alleyway have been spray-painted over many times
over the years.  One section of graffiti actually looks legible,
it says:    This section has been designed for levels 5 through 10
            If you are above level 15 please don't expect much fun.
            If you are below level 5 enter at your own risk.
Another section of graffiti says "Raff Rules!"
There is a boulevard to the east and Wall Road East is to the west.

This section of town has been overrun by the Troll gang.  Even the
police stay out of here for fear of being brutalized.  This was once
a nice lower-middleclass neighborhood, but know the gangs run the
streets.  All the shops and homes have been boarded up and abandoned.
An alleyway is to the west and the street continues east.  An over-

Ajax Avenue at chapel~
The temple to honor the minor gods is through a rusty metal door
to the west.  The street continues north and south.  You hear the
muffled sounds of screams coming from the chapel.

First intersection of Hector and Achilles~
There is a large statue here depicting a battle between two
great warriors.  You think it's odd that it has not been defiled,
but then you sense a aura protecting it.  Achilles runs east
and south, while Hector heads out to the north.

A large open space, possibly a cemetery, lies to the south.
There is a large wrought-iron fence with spikes on top
which prevents you from entering the area.  The street
continues east and west.

What is left of the weaponshop~
It doesn't even look like those punks gave the weaponsmith a
proper burial.  But what a going away present he seems to have
received!  Blood is splattered and dried all over the walls here.
It looks like a great deal of carnage happened here.  The way
out to the east leads out onto a street.

Ajax street at Weaponshop (or whats left of it)~
The street goes north and south.  The stables used to be to the
east, but I bet all the horses are dead or gone.

Khan Park~
Not really a "park" as you and i would think of it but
it seems queerly peaceful here in comparison to the rest of
the area.  There seems to be some kind of memorial to the
great Mongol warrior Khan being crudely constructed here.
There is a street to the east and another to the south.

A bend in Ajax~
The roads bends south and east here.  You barely notice
a small alley leading north.  Some kind of tunnel entrance
is to the west but it has been crushed under its own weight.

been demolished.  An inn/pub is to the south.  The street bends

A wide alleyway~
The sides of the alleyway have been vandalized many times.
One patch of graffiti actually looks readable:
            This section has been designed for levels 5 through 10
            If you are above level 10 please don't expect much.
            If you are below level 5 enter at your own risk.
In another spot it says "now entering Ogre territory..."
A street lies to the west and a major road to the east.

Alexander Road~
You see many gang members walking around looking for
fights to pick and things to break.  It seems as if all of the
other citizens have been run out of town.  All the former
homes are boarded up and uninhabitable.  The road continues
east and west.

The inn/pub~
The inn actually looks fairly functional despite its lack
of repair.  The boys come here to hoot it up and drink them selves
into oblivion sometimes.  It looks as if the beer is still on tap!!!
A hallway leads south and you spy a street through the doorway
to the north.

Solomon Street~
A wrought-iron fence blocks off what used to be an entrance to the
cemetery here to the north.  The evil just seems too strong to
to consider entering.  You feel you should stick with the "lesser"
evils along the road to the east and west.
