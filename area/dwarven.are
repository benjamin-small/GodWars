Mining equipment room~
This is the storage room for equipment used by the
Dwarven miners.  It is very small, and you can tell that
not many miners actually use any equipment.

Solved the Maze.~
You have solved the maze.  You can tell by the last few moves
that there is no way that a dumb worker could have figured that
out.  It seems pretty desolate here.  To the south is a bleak room.
To the north, you see the maze.  There is a sign above the south exit:

    Those who enter, plan on a timely death.
    Especially if you're loyal to the queen.

The Mazekeeper's Room~
You have entered the Mazekeeper's room.  There are pictures of
the Queen with darts thrown in it.  Spray-painted on the wall are
things like 'the queen shall suffer' and 'Catholics Rule'.

Bottom of mineshaft~
You are at the bottom of the mineshaft.  The air here is very sooty, and
it is very hard to breath.  The mineshaft leads up and east.
