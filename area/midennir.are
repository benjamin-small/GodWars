The Plains~
You are standing on the plains. This is a vast desolate place where the
wind can howl undisturbed since nothing but you bars its way. However you
are not the first to wander here. Before you somebody has left a small path.
The path looks rather bewildered and is not the kind of path to lead to
anywhere significant or important but it seems to have made up its mind to
enter the hills far away north.

the south.
