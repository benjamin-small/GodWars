He is the spirit of a once-mighty player killer, who was forced to 
repent his sins after death by helping young newbies for a hundred and 
one years, after which time his soul will be allowed eternal peace.

He can conjure up sub-issue vests, swords, daggers, maces, shields, and
war banners.  He also knows a few good area for new players...Maybe you
should ask him about the smurf village, the gnomes, the shire, or the
dwarven drop-off centre?

Welcome to combat training.

The first lesson is knowing whom to fight.  Use the command 'CONSIDER' to
consider killing a monster.  Avoid fighting monsters that will kill you
easily.

The second lesson is running away.  There is a monster in the room down.
He is too strong for you to kill, but he won't kill you.  So go 'DOWN' from
here, then 'CONSIDER' him, then 'KILL' him.  After a while, type 'FLEE' to
escape from him.

You can also set your character to flee automatically with the 'WIMPY' command.
Type 'HELP WIMPY' to find out more about 'WIMPY'.

After you flee, you will be back in this room.  When you are ready to go on
to the next station, go 'WEST'.

Welcome to the cage room.  The adepts of mud school have captured some
monsters for you to kill.  In the four cages are four monsters of various
types.  Kill them all!

After you kill each monster, get all of the equipment from their corpses
with the command 'GET ALL CORPSE'.  You can then use the command 'WEAR ALL'
to wear your newly won equipment.

When you are done with the corpse, 'SACRIFICE CORPSE' to give it to your God.
God will reward you for this.

Between combat, you may need to rest or sleep to regenerate hit points.
You can 'REST' to regenerate hit points, or you can 'SLEEP'.  'SLEEP' will
refresh you faster than 'REST', but you will be less aware of your
surroundings.

You have graduated from Mud School!  Get your diploma.  Go 'NORTH' from here
to visit our arena.  There are plenty of low-level monsters, but DON'T attack
other players.

If you want to go directly back to the temple at any time, type 'RECALL'.

After you raise to level two, you can 'SAVE' your character.  Your character
will be automatically SAVE'd every few minutes.

If you need more help during the game, type 'HELP'.  If you see something
wrong or have comments, use 'BUG', 'IDEA', or 'TYPO' to report them.

May your visit here be ... mercenary.

Hatchet's Guild Room~
You are in a room filled with weapons, books, and many combat dummies, some
cut and stabbed many times, others burnt to a crisp.  The room is filled with
sweat and an aura of magic.  There is a sign on the wall.

Welcome to Hatchet's Guild Room.  Here you will learn your skills and spells.
To find out what skills and spells you can practice and how many practice
sessions you have, type 'practice'.  To practice the specific skill, type
'practice <skill>', where 'skill' is the skill or spell you wish to practice.
Practicing increases the amount you know of that skill or spell, up to a
